Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: NO. Neural network with model architectures 'vgg' and 'resnet' correctly classified the dog breed as German shepherd dog, 'alexnet' classified it as Malinois. 


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: NO. Neural network with model architectures 'vgg' and 'resnet' classify the breed of dog on image Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg to be the same breed. Alexnet misclassified dog on image Dog_01.jpg as Malinois and on Dog_02 classify it correctly as German shepherd dog.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: YES


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Both 'vgg' and 'resnet' outperform the 'alexnet'. Base on result for classification of just four images I would pick 'resnet' as neural network model architecture because it has same accuracy as 'vgg' and it perform calculations much faster.
